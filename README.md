# shallowcopyvsdeepcopy

Deep Copy :
Completely a new object will be created and it will have the same data as like original object
If data is changed in the original object, data will not get changed with the new object
Hence, creation of an object via deep copying is a 100% unique object


Shallow Copy :
Whole data of an object is not copied instead only object reference is copied
If data is changed in the original object, copied object data also gets changed
Hence, creation of an object via shallow copying is not a unique object
